clean slate 

more organized approach, going back to square one

html-set up and better naming practices. i.e. attaching the js- prefix to any element we want to call into our javascript files. And also being specific and descriptive. 

primarily for my own sanity, I realize that I spent most of thursday and friday in a panic mode and wasn't thinking clearly enough to recognize that I needed to do a more thorough examination of all the things we grazed over in the past week. 

I also have a weird relationship with asking for help and recognizing what I need in order to really learn, lol, this is the second stab. I'm putting all of this down here first.
